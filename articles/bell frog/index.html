        <h1>Green and Golden Bell Frog</h1>
        <p>The Green and Golden Bell Frog (Litoria aurea) is a vibrant amphibian, native to eastern Australia, that
            has found a second home in New Zealand. Introduced in the late 19th century, this species has successfully
            established itself, primarily in the upper North Island. While the frog's presence in New Zealand is often
            seen as a conservation paradox—a thriving population of a species declining in its native range—its
            ecological role and impact on the New Zealand environment are complex and continue to be studied.</p>

            style="width: auto; height: 700px; display: block; margin: auto;">
        <h2>Origins and Establishment in New Zealand</h2>
        <p>The story of the Green and Golden Bell Frog in New Zealand began in the 1860s. Driven by the desires of
            acclimatisation societies, these frogs were intentionally introduced from Sydney. These societies aimed to
            introduce various non-native species, often to create a fauna more reminiscent of Europe, or to serve as
            biological control agents. While releases were attempted in various locations, the Green and Golden Bell
            Frog primarily established itself in the warmer, northern parts of the North Island. This successful
            colonization can be attributed to several factors, including the availability of suitable habitat and a
            relative lack of natural predators.</p>

        <h2>Ecological Characteristics and Habitat</h2>
        <p>Green and Golden Bell Frogs are relatively large frogs, with females growing significantly larger than males.
            Their appearance is striking, characterized by smooth, bright green skin interspersed with patches of gold
            or bronze. This coloration provides effective camouflage in their preferred habitats.</p>
        <p>In New Zealand, these frogs are typically found in a range of damp or aquatic environments. They favor
            habitats such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ponds and streams</li>
            <li>Swamps and wetlands</li>
            <li>Dune-lands</li>
            <li>Modified environments like farmland, roadside ditches, and urban areas with suitable water bodies</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A key habitat requirement is the presence of shallow water bodies, often with emergent vegetation, for
            breeding. They are frequently found in areas that are open and sunny, as they are known to bask in the sun—a
            somewhat unusual behavior among frogs.</p>

            style="width: auto; height: 700px; display: block; margin: auto;">

        <h2>Life Cycle and Behavior</h2>
        <p>The Green and Golden Bell Frog has a typical amphibian life cycle. Breeding occurs during the warmer months,
            from spring to summer. Males congregate around water bodies and produce a distinctive, deep, guttural call
            to attract females. Females lay large numbers of eggs, which hatch into tadpoles. The tadpole stage is
            aquatic, and tadpoles feed on algae and detritus. Metamorphosis into juvenile frogs occurs after a period of
            several weeks to months, depending on environmental conditions.</p>
        <p>Adult Green and Golden Bell Frogs are opportunistic predators. Their diet includes a wide variety of
            invertebrates, such as insects, as well as other frogs (including their own species) and small vertebrates.
            This generalist feeding behavior contributes to their ability to thrive in diverse environments.</p>

        <h2>Conservation Status: A Paradoxical Situation</h2>
        <p>The conservation status of the Green and Golden Bell Frog presents a paradox. In their native Australia, the
            species has experienced significant population declines and is classified as Vulnerable. The primary threats
            to Australian populations include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Habitat loss and degradation</li>
            <li>Disease, particularly chytridiomycosis (caused by the amphibian chytrid fungus)</li>
            <li>Predation by introduced species</li>
            <li>Pollution</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In stark contrast, in New Zealand, the Green and Golden Bell Frog is classified as "Introduced and
            Naturalised" and is not considered threatened. Indeed, the relatively healthy populations in New Zealand
            have, at times, been considered a potential резерв for the species.</p>

        <h2>Ecological Impacts and Management Considerations</h2>
        <p>While the Green and Golden Bell Frog has established itself successfully in New Zealand, its presence is not
            without ecological implications. As an introduced species, it has the potential to impact native ecosystems.
            Potential impacts include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Predation on native species:</strong> Green and Golden Bell Frogs are known to consume a variety
                of prey, and there is a risk that they may prey on native invertebrates or even small vertebrates.</li>
            <li><strong>Competition:</strong> Competition with native species for resources, though the extent of
                competition with New Zealand's unique native frog species (*Leiopelma*) is limited, as their habitats
                don't overlap significantly.</li>
            <li><strong>Disease transmission:</strong> The role of Green and Golden Bell Frogs in the transmission of
                diseases, such as chytridiomycosis, to native amphibians is a concern, although the full extent of this
                risk is still being studied.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Management of Green and Golden Bell Frogs in New Zealand is complex. Given that the species is
            well-established and not considered a conservation concern within the country, there is no widespread effort
            to control their populations. However, ongoing research and monitoring are important to understand their
            ecological role and potential impacts.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The Green and Golden Bell Frog in New Zealand represents a fascinating case study in introduced species
            ecology. Its successful establishment and thriving populations offer a contrast to its declining status in
            its native Australia. While the frog has become a naturalized part of New Zealand's fauna, its ecological
            impacts require ongoing attention. Balancing the conservation of a threatened species in its native range
            with the management of its introduced populations in a new environment presents complex challenges for
            conservationists and land managers.</p>
