    <h1>TERMS</h1>

    <h2>SECURITY</h2>
    <p>Our shopping cart is secure and protected by SSL encryption technology. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a method of
        ensuring that information submitted through your web site is secure and cannot be accessed by unauthorised
        users. When a site offers an SSL-secured form, the information submitted via that form (typically credit card
        information) is encrypted using a special certificate key and then decrypted with another key after it has been
        transmitted. When you access a site secured with SSL using your browser, a symbol displays in the browser window
        indicating that the site is secure.</p>
        <br/>
    <h2>PRICING</h2>
    <p>Pricing is as shown, however we are not registered for GST (Goods and Services Tax), so no GST is included in the
        price.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to alter prices on the site without notice. The price of a product displayed on the website
        at the time the order is received will be accepted and honoured as correct.</p>
        <br/>
    <h2>PAYMENT</h2>
    <p>We accept Visa, MasterCard, Apple Pay, Google Pay, Afterpay and Laybuy as well as direct deposits to our bank
        account. We use Stripe for the processing of payments via credit card. Goods will only be dispatched once full
        payment has been received and funds have been cleared.</p>
    <p>An automatic email confirmation of the order will be sent to the customer's registered email address.
        Matai Moorfield reserves the right to review and/or cancel orders containing information that cannot be
        verified.</p>
<br/>
    <h2>CANCELLATION OF ORDERS</h2>

        order, you are requested to contact Matai Moorfield within 24 hours of placing your online order. Requests for
        cancellation will be considered on a case-by-case basis and Matai Moorfield will exercise its sole discretion in
